The creation of a streaming API based on RESTapi methodology. This python package manager, pip was the default choice used in this project.

The maximum number of messages can be set to any values of choice. This is results in a stream of batches with 5 seconds delay interval. This should be set to the rate that the user can consume with hastle. 

The approach is to grab all the data available on a receive_message() call. This data is passed to the user on a RESTful API powered by a combination of flask and gevent for a non blocking streaming data. The data comes in a stream using the asynchronious communication provided by Gevent.

Installation

install boto3
$ pip install boto3
Check ( https://github.com/boto/boto3 ).

install flask
$ pip install Flask
Check ( http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/installation/ ).

install fabric
$ pip install fabric
Check ( http://www.fabfile.org/installing.html ).

install gevent
You must use this version to avoid the issues discussed in the limitations.
$ pip install cython git+git://github.com/surfly/gevent.git#egg=gevent
Check ( https://github.com/Eugeny/gevent )

How to use the software
Add the credentials for accessing AWS in the config and credentials file in the settings folder.


To start the web server
$ python command.py


Limitations

There is a known issue with the current version of Gevent works with python 2.7.8 and lower because of broken ssl module. Check ( https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/issues/120 )

The current http code that is supported are 200 and 404. Future work would involve running the app using a headless browser like Requests by Kenneth Reiz and obtain the http code which is be useful for debugging. This will result in customized error messages.


Testing
Navigate to root

$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8001/
This obtains the information about the health of the service.

$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8001/messages
This provides the message in a data stream

Run the test
$ py.test
